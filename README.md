# EGIER-Production-Forecasting-Capacity-Planning
This study utilizes a high-accuracy Non-Linear Hybrid Scaled Regression model ($R^2=0.9957$) to validate production totals and forecast storage needs. The analysis predicts warehouse saturation by Month 167, recommending that facility expansion begins in Month 155 (November 2030) to prevent capacity issues.



## Overview
This project analyzes 144 months of bag production data to determine the optimal timing for new warehouse construction. By applying numerical methods (Trapezoidal Rule, Differentiation), we validated cumulative production with only **1.45% error** and identified that the current capacity (25k units) will be exceeded in **Month 167**.

##  Key Methods
- **Modeling:** Non-Linear Hybrid Scaled Regression
- **Validation:** Numerical Analysis (Truncation Error)
- **Integration:** Trapezoidal Rule for cumulative totals
- **Forecasting:** Strategic expansion planning (13-month lead time)

##  Key Findings
- **Max Growth:** November 2021 (Month 47)
- **Cumulative Production:** 255,843 units
- **Action Plan:** Initiate new warehouse construction by **November 2030 (Month 155)**.
